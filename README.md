# Root Folder Search

This package finds the root directory of a project by traversing the ancestors directories starting at a given path.

I used it to overcome a limitation in Jupyter Notebooks, that doesn't provide the __file__ variable that would let me easily find the root folder of a project, regardless the current working directory. You might find it useful in other scenarios.
